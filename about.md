This project is a work in progress. It serves as a reminder that for all the
technology that we are involved with in digital preservation that it is people
at the core of our work. Where layers of bureaucracy make this often seem 
forgotten. Bad apples too. We want to celebrate those who recognise their peers. 
We want to support those who need it and who aren't being treated with the 
respect and dignity we all deserve in our daily lives.
