A little over a year ago, a list of code of conducts was moved off Ross Spencer's personal github page to a community owned resource & project, and so Digital Preservation is People was born. 

We started this project after a few particularly trying and isolating experiences. We recognized that while there are a lot of great organizations advocating for digital preservation as a practice, there was room for improvement when it came to advocating for the people doing the work. 

A concrete way of assessing this gap was looking at our major conferences and organizations without code of conducts. This list was a way putting those organizations lacking a CoC on notice, while also collection resources and references for creating and enforcing code of conducts.

## Looking back on 2018

Some incremental changes were made, and we can celebrate those changes while looking forward to what's next and what further work can be done. As in digital preservation, the work is in the maintenance, not just the creation. 

Some highlights include:

* [iPres 2018 adopted the first iPres code of conduct and response framework](https://ipres2018.org/code-of-conduct)
* [The Digital Preservation Coalition created an Inclusion and Diversity policy](https://www.dpconline.org/docs/miscellaneous/about/1807-dpc-inclusion-and-diversity-policy/file)
* The 2018 Digital Library Foundation Forum's Call for Proposals stated that: ["“Manels”—all-male-identifying panels—will not be accepted into the conference, and proposals involving a wide diversity of speakers will be looked on favorably by the committee."](https://forum2018.diglib.org/call-for-proposals/)

# Looking forward 

When we originally started this project, we also wanted it to be a space where people could share their own positive and negative experiences in the field, anonymously if they chose. And, while we haven't done that yet, it is still something we want to be a platform for. If anyone has suggestions about how to create a safe, anonymous 'tip line' of sorts to facilitate this, let us know!

While Code of Conducts are a fine ethical barometer for the digital preservation community, there are still lots of systemic issues that need to be addressed, assessed, and corrected. One of these is the need for hiring institutions value our labor monetarily. While it is great that loads of people and institutions are coming around to digital preservation, and there are more professional opportunities for us to do our work, and while we love what we do, we need to be paid accordingly. 

<something about open source projects being done on a voluntary basis here maybe>?

When we say digital preservation is people, we mean that we need to recognize the humanity (and humans!) behind what we do. We are not thought leaders or idiosyncratic individuals. We are not file format identifications or metadata standards. We are not systems or workflows or history grabber machines. We are people and a community of practice. Digital preservation does not work without us.
