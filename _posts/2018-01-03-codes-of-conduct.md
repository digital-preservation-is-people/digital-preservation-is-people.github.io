This project began with the creation of a list of digital preservation and digital preservation related organisations who maintained codes of conduct. Or didn't.

The list can be found here: [Digital Preservation Codes of Conduct](https://github.com/digital-preservation-is-people/digipres-codes-of-conduct)

For those who want to contribute to that list, please feel free to do so in a number of ways:

- Create a [pull request](https://github.com/digital-preservation-is-people/digipres-codes-of-conduct/pulls) with the new information
- Create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/digital-preservation-is-people/digipres-codes-of-conduct/issues)

Keep talking on social networks such as Twitter. Use the hashtag #digipres people. We'll do our best to find it.
