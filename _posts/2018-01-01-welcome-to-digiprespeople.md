Welcome to Digital Preservation is People. It is a community owned project that aims to affect change across a diverse, talented, and growing community. This is a landing page and a work in progress. As is the [About](https://digital-preservation-is-people.github.io/about) page here. 

As we are in the beginning stages of this project. It may be difficult to see how we want to shape this. There is a proposed statement of intent:

> It serves as a reminder that for all the technology that we are involved with in digital preservation that it is <b>people</b> at the core of our work.

## The project

The project is open source. Anyone who wants to become a member simply has to signal their intent and a large number of folk on here can make them a member of this organisation too.

The project hopes to gather stories from the community of any nature. We need article writers! We also need ideas for articles. Content, ideas, and links to other articles we should be aware of can be submitted via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/digital-preservation-is-people/digital-preservation-is-people.github.io/issues). 

We are working to find a mechanism for folks to contribute anonymously. If you are happy to engage with a particular issue with your GitHub account feel free to submit your content. If you are uncomfortable in any way, but know and trust one of the repository organizers you can send your content to them for publishing and your identity will remain safe.

Contributed stories about the good and bad examples of looking after folk in our community will be published so that they can be shared and the experiences not lost or considered too inconvenient to remember. Submissions surrounding anything that emphasizes the people in our work can be published here.  

## Preserving Anonymity

The anonymity of reader contributed content and stories personally affecting them will be treated with the greatest amount of respect possible. The anonimity of the contributor will be valued. Ways to contribute are currently being considered, and suggestions on the best approaches to this are welcome. 

## How to share, how to contribute

This work does need to be shared, but you only need to do what you can. Blog about it. Tweet about it. Retweet others. Like their work. Talk about it at work. Talk about it to your friends; your family. Engage as much or as little as you can. That is all we ask. Thank you! 

## Code of conduct
